# Livelock vs Deadlock Simulation

This project is a JavaScript-based simulation designed to illustrate the differences between **livelock** and **deadlock** scenarios in operating systems. It serves as an educational tool to help understand concurrency issues and thread synchronization problems.

## 🔍 Overview

The simulation demonstrates:

- **Deadlock**: A situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource.
- **Livelock**: A situation where threads are not blocked but keep changing their state in response to each other without making any actual progress.

By visualizing these scenarios, users can gain a clearer understanding of how such issues occur and how they differ.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (99.1%)
- **Other**: 0.9%

> Note: The project is implemented primarily in JavaScript.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the simulation locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashwin-2408/Livelock-Vs-Deadlock-Simulation.git
